        <p>
          Unbeknownst to me at the time, I started my journey into software
          engineering in 2012. What started out as curious hobbying soon became
          a full-blown passion. I’ve had content management roles for various
          websites across multiple platforms – <strong>Joomla</strong>,
          <strong>Weebly</strong>, <strong>Sitecore</strong>,
          <strong>SharePoint</strong> – and began learning the basics of coding
          as a result. I couldn’t get enough.
        </p>
        <p>
          September 2016, I had left my job and finished the first six weeks of
          pre-work for an 18-week coding bootcamp and, before the in-class
          portion started, we were asked to take the StrengthsFinder Assessment.
          After taking it, I found that ‘Learner’ is one of my top five
          strengths and I laughed out loud at this tidbit from one of the
          results guides:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          ‘Seek roles that require some form of technical competence. You will
          enjoy the process of acquiring and maintaining this expertise. As far
          as possible, shift your career toward a field with constantly changing
          technologies or regulations. You will be energized by the challenge of
          keeping up.’
        </blockquote>
        <p>
          It was like a strange little fortune cookie, portending my future that
          had already begun to unfurl. I smiled and nodded, feeling energized by
          what the future holds. Incidentally, my number one strength is
          'Futuristic'.
        </p>
          <h3>Onward and upward!</h3>
